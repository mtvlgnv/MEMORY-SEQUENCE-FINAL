# MEMORY SEQUENCE

AUTHORS: MATVEI LOGINOV AND ANDRII STEPANENKO

Our project is a Java-based game inspired by Cognitive Skill tests that efficiently uses UI/UX elements and GIT as its topics of choice. In the game the player has to face randomly-generated patterns of emerging tiles on ever-enlarging screen and repeat them in order to get to the next level. Memory Sequence has the settings menu where the user can change the way he plays the game, by setting the time to remember the sequence and changing the starting difficulty. 

To play the game you have to download all the files and run the **Main.java** file. After opening the game, your computer will open a window with the starting screen with three options:
- Start the game
- Info on how to play
- Settings

Settings button allows you to change the time you are given to memorize tiles and switch the start level. Info button gives you brief intro on how to play the main game. Start button starts the game. By pressing start you will be redirected to a new window with the main game. You will be shown a certain amount of black tiles in random positions and your goal will be to remember their positions and fill them in 5 seconds. If you fill them correctly, you proceed to the next level, otherwise you lose a life, 3 of which you have in total. As you proceed, your screen will get bigger and it will become significantly harder to remember everything in the right positions. At the top of the screen you can see your main stats. If you lose all 3 lives, you will be redirected to the Game Over screen, which will show your score, your amount of levels and high score. Then You will be redirected back to the start screen.

Try getting more than 280 points, that's the highscore of developers!

Good luck!
